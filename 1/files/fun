[Coldplay:]
I know it's over before she says
I know it falls at the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits
For a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

[Coldplay:]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
Oh, come on don't give up
Don't see me give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh, didn't we have fun?

[Coldplay & Tove Lo:]
I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
"I know it's over," Icarus says
To the sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight 'til it's over,
Fight 'til it's done

[Coldplay & Tove Lo:]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world, stopping in its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
Before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

[Coldplay & Tove Lo:]
'Cause you and me
We were always meant to... always meant to be
We were always meant to... always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to... always meant to be

Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh, didn't we have fun?

[Coldplay:]
But then...
Maybe we could again
