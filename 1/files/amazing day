We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine saying,
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design."

And time seemed to say,
"Forget the world and its weight."
And here I just want to stay

Amazing day
Amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place
Where you can be what you are

And the view, the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms I just want to sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

And I asked
Can the Birds in poetry, chime?
Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?
Oh, thanks God, must have heard when I prayed
'Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Yeah, today
