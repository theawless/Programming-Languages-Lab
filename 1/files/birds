Been standing in the corner
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escape
Will keep you up at night

But someone had put the flare up
Got me in rays
So... I guess I better stay

"Uh uh, no come on!" you say

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just warning rain
Don't let the fears just start, what if
I won't see you again
Around here you never want to
Sleep all night

So start falling in love,
Start the riot
And come on rage with me

We don't need words
We'll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography

Come on and raise it
Come on raise this noise
For the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on, it's not over!
If you mean it say loud
Come on, all for love
Out from the underground

Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
We'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Fearless through this you said
We'll go
Through this together (ooohh)
When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool
